## Step 2: Verify Sender Email Address

SendGrid requires you to verify the email address that sends emails from your website.

### Option A: Verify Single Sender (Recommended - Easier)

1. **Navigate to Sender Authentication**
   - Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth
   - Click **"Verify a Single Sender"**

2. **Fill Out the Form**
   - **From Name:** `MyTinyCEO`
   - **From Email Address:** `noreply@mytinyceo.com` (or `steve@4castconcrete.com` if you prefer)
   - **Reply To:** `steve@4castconcrete.com`
   - **Company Address:** Your business address
   - **Nickname:** `MyTinyCEO Contact Form`

3. **Verify Email**
   - Click **"Create"**
   - Check your email inbox (the "From Email Address" you entered)
   - Click the verification link in the email from SendGrid
   - ‚úÖ You'll see "Verified!" status in SendGrid

### Option B: Domain Authentication (Advanced - Better Deliverability)

If you want better email deliverability and to send from @mytinyceo.com:

1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth
2. Click **"Authenticate Your Domain"**
3. Follow SendGrid's wizard to add DNS records to your domain
4. Update the API endpoint code to use your verified domain email

---

## Step 3: Add API Key to Local Development

1. **Open the `.env` file** in the root of your project
   - File location: `/Website/.env`

2. **Replace the placeholder with your actual API key:**
   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Save the file**

4. **Test locally** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Navigate to http://localhost:4321/contact
   - Fill out and submit the contact form
   - Check if you receive the email at steve@4castconcrete.com

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Never commit the `.env` file to Git! It's already in `.gitignore`.

---

## Step 4: Add API Key to Vercel (Production)

Once you've deployed your site to Vercel:

1. **Go to Your Vercel Project Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your **MyTinyCEO.com** project

2. **Navigate to Environment Variables**
   - Click on **"Settings"** tab
   - Click on **"Environment Variables"** in the left sidebar

3. **Add New Environment Variable**
   - Click **"Add New"** button
   - **Key:** `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** Paste your SendGrid API key (starts with `SG.`)
   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click **"Save"**

4. **Redeploy Your Site**
   - Go to the **"Deployments"** tab
   - Click the **"..."** menu on the latest deployment
   - Click **"Redeploy"**
   - OR: Just push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

---

## Step 5: Update Sender Email in Code (If Needed)

If you verified a different email address than `noreply@mytinyceo.com`:

1. **Open:** `src/pages/api/contact.ts`

2. **Find line with `from:`** (around line 42)
   ```typescript
   from: 'noreply@mytinyceo.com', // Must be a verified sender in SendGrid
   ```

3. **Change to your verified email:**
   ```typescript
   from: 'steve@4castconcrete.com', // Must be a verified sender in SendGrid
   ```

4. **Commit and push the change:**
   ```bash
   git add src/pages/api/contact.ts
   git commit -m "Update SendGrid sender email"
   git push
   ```
