## Step 2: Verify Sender Email Address

SendGrid requires you to verify the email address that sends emails from your website.

### Option A: Verify Single Sender (Recommended - Easier)

1. **Navigate to Sender Authentication**
   - Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth
   - Click **"Verify a Single Sender"**

2. **Fill Out the Form**
   - **From Name:** `MyTinyCEO`
   - **From Email Address:** `noreply@mytinyceo.com` (or `steve@4castconcrete.com` if you prefer)
   - **Reply To:** `steve@4castconcrete.com`
   - **Company Address:** Your business address
   - **Nickname:** `MyTinyCEO Contact Form`

3. **Verify Email**
   - Click **"Create"**
   - Check your email inbox (the "From Email Address" you entered)
   - Click the verification link in the email from SendGrid
   - ‚úÖ You'll see "Verified!" status in SendGrid

### Option B: Domain Authentication (Advanced - Better Deliverability)

If you want better email deliverability and to send from @mytinyceo.com:

1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth
2. Click **"Authenticate Your Domain"**
3. Follow SendGrid's wizard to add DNS records to your domain
4. Update the API endpoint code to use your verified domain email

## Step 3: Add Environment Variables to Local Development

1. **Open the `.env` file** in the root of your project
   - File location: `/Website/.env`

2. **Configure all SendGrid environment variables:**
   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key_here
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@4castconcrete.com
   SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL=steve@4castconcrete.com
   ```

3. **Save the file**

4. **Test locally** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Navigate to http://localhost:4321/contact
   - Fill out and submit the contact form
   - Check if you receive the email at steve@4castconcrete.com

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Never commit the `.env` file to Git! It's already in `.gitignore`.

---

## Step 4: Add Environment Variables to Vercel (Production)

Once you've deployed your site to Vercel:

1. **Go to Your Vercel Project Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your **MyTinyCEO.com** project

2. **Navigate to Environment Variables**
   - Click on **"Settings"** tab
   - Click on **"Environment Variables"** in the left sidebar

3. **Add All Three Environment Variables**

   Add each variable by clicking **"Add New"** button:

   **Variable 1:**
   - **Key:** `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** Your SendGrid API key (starts with `SG.`)
   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click **"Save"**

   **Variable 2:**
   - **Key:** `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`
   - **Value:** `noreply@4castconcrete.com`
   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click **"Save"**

   **Variable 3:**
   - **Key:** `SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL`
   - **Value:** `steve@4castconcrete.com`
   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click **"Save"**

4. **Redeploy Your Site**
   - Go to the **"Deployments"** tab
   - Click the **"..."** menu on the latest deployment
   - Click **"Redeploy"**
   - OR: Just push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

## Step 5: Update Email Addresses (If Needed)

The contact form is now configured to use environment variables. If you need to change email addresses:

**For Local Development:**
1. Update the `.env` file with new email addresses
2. Restart the dev server (`npm run dev`)

**For Production (Vercel):**
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Update the `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` and/or `SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL` variables
3. Redeploy the site

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember:** The `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` must be verified in SendGrid!
