      <div class="prose max-w-none mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-bold text-steel-blue mb-4">My SBA Loan Journey</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
          When I decided to seek funding for 4Cast Concrete Solutions, my architectural precast concrete software company, I thought it would be straightforward. I had a solid business idea, years of industry experience, and the technical skills to build the product. How hard could getting a loan be?
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Turns out—pretty hard.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The Small Business Administration (SBA) has incredible loan programs designed to help entrepreneurs like us. The SBA 7(a) loan program alone guarantees billions of dollars in loans every year. But here's the catch: the documentation requirements are extensive, and if you're not a finance person (I'm a technologist and COO, not a CFO), it can feel overwhelming.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I spent weeks trying to piece together financial projections in Excel, researching industry benchmarks, and trying to figure out what "pro forma financial statements" even meant. I'd Google terms like "debt service coverage ratio" at midnight, trying to understand if my numbers made sense.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
          That frustration is why I eventually built MyTinyCEO—an AI-powered business planning tool that generates all the financial documentation you need for an SBA loan application, explained in plain English. But before we talk about solutions, let me walk you through exactly what you need.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- What is an SBA Loan -->
      <div class="prose max-w-none mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-bold text-steel-blue mb-4">What is an SBA Loan?</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The SBA (Small Business Administration) doesn't actually lend you money directly. Instead, they partner with banks and lenders to <strong>guarantee</strong> a portion of your loan—typically up to 85%. This guarantee reduces the risk for lenders, making them more willing to approve loans for small businesses that might not otherwise qualify.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-steel-blue p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
          <h3 class="font-heading font-semibold text-steel-blue mb-2">Quick Definition</h3>
          <p class="text-charcoal mb-0">
            <strong>SBA Guarantee:</strong> The SBA promises to repay the lender a percentage of your loan if you default. This makes banks more comfortable lending to startups and small businesses.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
          There are several types of SBA loans, but the most common are:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-charcoal mb-6">
          <li><strong>SBA 7(a) Loan:</strong> The most popular. Up to $5 million for working capital, equipment, real estate, or refinancing debt.</li>
          <li><strong>SBA 504 Loan:</strong> Specifically for purchasing fixed assets like buildings or heavy equipment. Up to $5.5 million.</li>
          <li><strong>SBA Microloan:</strong> Smaller loans up to $50,000 for startups and small businesses.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
          For most small business owners and startups, the <strong>7(a) loan</strong> is what you'll be applying for, so that's what we'll focus on.
        </p>
      </div>

          Here's everything you'll need. I've organized this based on what banks actually ask for, not just what the SBA website says. Trust me—there's a difference.

              <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you're a new business without all these documents yet, don't panic. Some lenders work with startups, but you'll need an even stronger business plan to compensate.

            This is where most people get stuck. Banks want to see that you understand your numbers and can realistically pay back the loan.

          <li>Customer acquisition strategy</li>
          <li>Break-even analysis showing when I could start repaying the loan</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The hardest part? Proving my market assumptions were realistic. Banks don't want to see "we'll capture 10% of the market" without backing it up. I had to:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-charcoal mb-6">
          <li>Research how many precast concrete manufacturers exist in the U.S.</li>
          <li>Estimate how many could afford software subscriptions</li>
          <li>Show comparable SaaS companies in adjacent industries</li>
          <li>Calculate realistic customer acquisition costs</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-4">
          This took me weeks. With MyTinyCEO, Tiny would've researched the market, suggested pricing based on industry comps, and generated financial scenarios (best case, worst case, realistic case) automatically.

          <p class="text-charcoal mb-0">
            <strong>The Result:</strong> I got the documentation together, but it took 6 weeks of nights and weekends. That's why I built MyTinyCEO—to help other founders do this in hours, not months.

        <p class="text-lg text-charcoal leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I've seen (and made) these mistakes. Avoid them:
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-heading font-bold text-steel-blue mb-2">1. Overly Optimistic Projections</h3>
            <p class="text-charcoal mb-0">
              "We'll hit $1 million in revenue by year 2!" Banks see through this. Your projections need to be backed by realistic assumptions. Show your work.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-heading font-bold text-steel-blue mb-2">2. Ignoring Your Competition</h3>
            <p class="text-charcoal mb-0">
              Saying "we have no competitors" is a red flag. Every business has competition, even if it's indirect. Show you understand your market.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-heading font-bold text-steel-blue mb-2">3. Poor Personal Credit</h3>
            <p class="text-charcoal mb-0">
              Your personal credit score matters. For SBA loans, you typically need a 680+ credit score. If yours is lower, work on improving it first.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-heading font-bold text-steel-blue mb-2">4. Vague Use of Funds</h3>
            <p class="text-charcoal mb-0">
              "We need $100k for growth" isn't good enough. Break it down: $40k for inventory, $30k for marketing, $20k for equipment, $10k for working capital.
            </p>
          </div>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-3 text-lg text-charcoal">
          <li><strong>Start early.</strong> Gathering documents takes longer than you think. Give yourself 2-3 months.</li>
          <li><strong>Work with an SBA-preferred lender.</strong> They know the process and can guide you through it.</li>
          <li><strong>Be conservative with projections.</strong> It's better to under-promise and over-deliver.</li>
          <li><strong>Show skin in the game.</strong> Banks want to see you're investing your own money too. Expect to put down 10-20%.</li>
          <li><strong>Tell your story.</strong> Don't just submit numbers. Explain why you're passionate about this business and why you're the right person to run it.</li>
          <li><strong>Ask questions.</strong> If you don't understand something, ask your lender. There are no dumb questions.</li>
