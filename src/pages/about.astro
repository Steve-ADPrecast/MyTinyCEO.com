  <!-- The Problem I Faced -->

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-bold text-steel-blue mb-6">The Problem I Faced</h2>
      <div class="prose max-w-none text-charcoal font-body space-y-4">
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I'm a third-generation bricklayer who grew up in a diverse, hard-working environment. Eventually, I graduated summa cum laude with a technology degree and built a career in computer science and operations leadership.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Today, I'm the COO for an architectural precast concrete company in North Carolina. We needed a software solution to track production and analyze our business. I spent six months searching, meeting with developers, weighing costs and benefitsâ€”but everything was expensive, built on outdated tech, and didn't do exactly what we needed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          So I built it myself. That's how 4Cast Concrete was born.

  <!-- How I Built MyTinyCEO -->
  <section class="py-16 bg-gray-50">
    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-bold text-steel-blue mb-6">How I Built MyTinyCEO</h2>
      <div class="prose max-w-none text-charcoal font-body space-y-4">
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Once 4Cast Concrete was ready to launch, I needed to talk to investors and lenders for fundraising. But I don't have a background in elite business or finance. When I started preparing a business plan, I realized I needed help.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Instead of hiring a CEO, I decided to program my own. I built MyTinyCEO as a tool to help me understand the value of my product and figure out how much money I could pay back before taking on debt or investors.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I researched proven business frameworks from top business schools like TAM/SAM/SOM, Value Stick Analysis, and Unit Economics. I wanted my plan to be investor-grade, not just "good enough." But I also wanted it to be accessibleâ€”I'm not a finance person, so why should other founders need to be?
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          That's when I added Tiny, the AI mentor. Tiny explains everything in plain English and answers questions in context. After months of building (and using it for my own business), I realized: other founders need this too.

  <!-- My Vision -->
  <section class="py-16 bg-white">
    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-heading font-bold text-steel-blue mb-6">My Vision</h2>
      <div class="prose max-w-none text-charcoal font-body space-y-4">
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          MyTinyCEO isn't just a toolâ€”it's a movement.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Business planning shouldn't require an MBA. Financial education should be accessible. And AI can democratize what used to be reserved for those who could afford consultants.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I want MyTinyCEO to become the standard. Like how investors say "send me your pitch deck," I want them to say "show me your MyTinyCEO plan."
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I want banks to require it for loan applicantsâ€”because it ensures quality and completeness. Think CarFax, but for business plans.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I'm building this in public. I'm bootstrapping (no VC fundingâ€”yet). And I'm using MyTinyCEO to plan my own growth.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold">
          If you're a founder who's ever felt overwhelmed by spreadsheets, this tool is for you.
